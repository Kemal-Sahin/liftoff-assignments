## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is going to be an application called LoadTracker. The purpose of the app is to give someone
working for a trucking company the ability to easily view their current loads in a list and update the
list as needed. I have family and friends who work in the trucking industry and I felt like an app like
this would be a perfect way to show that I can create something that gives the user CRUD capabilities. 
### Features
The features will include the ability for multiple users to login, then the ability to view a list with
all of the current loads and get several pieces of information pertaining to the load. For example, they
will be able to see where the load originated from, where it's going, who the driver is, contact info for
that driver and a field to add comments about the load. There will also be the ability to delete loads as
well as add loads as needed. 
### Technologies
I plan on using Spring Boot & Java connected to a Bongo Database for the backend and Javascript with React
and Bootstrap for the UI. 
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use React, Bongo and how to make sure the front end and back end work with each other.
